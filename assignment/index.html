    <p>I'm not totally sure if how many = signs I placed in code lines # 32 & 48 mattered or not. (2 vs 3) I'm having a hard time conceptualizing a type conversion vs exact match for just number values? <u>I did learn that I break the code if I try to only use one = vs two so I guess thats something haha</u></p>
